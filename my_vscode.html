    <p class="hed" id="change">OUR VISION</p>
    <p class="para" id="anime">To produce financially independent and self-sufficient leaders and entrepreneurs who will inspire others and positively influence their generation as a whole. </p>
    <p class="hed"></p>
    <p class="para"></p>

    <p class="hed" id="change">OUR MISSION</p>
    <p class="para" id="anime">To raise one million financially independent people who will raise others so that together we can have a positive impact on the world. </p>

    <p class="hed">OVERVIEW</p>
    <p class="para">This school was founded out of a desire to see young people discover their purpose early on, have a clear vision, and thus become successful and wealthy leaders in life. 
      The majority of circular schools in Africa and other continents today do not teach financial education or how to create wealth, which is why most countries have so many broke professors. 
      Many professionals at the pinnacle of their careers continue to struggle financially. It is very pathetic that many people who have dedicated their entire lives to serving their country end up as poor retirees who rely on the government for survival. The reason is not far-fetched. The majority of higher education institutions in Africa and the rest of the world concentrate on teaching the millions of undergraduates who graduate each year with certificates but are unable to work on their own. 
      The majority of these graduates use their strong credentials to search for employment, but sadly, only a small number of those with connections are able to secure the few good jobs that are available. 
      Many people's jobs are compared to slavery because of the ridiculously low pay. People become dissatisfied and settle for less in the hopes that things will improve eventually. Unfortunately, the economy is unfriendly to all. 
      The harsh economy has an adverse effect on both young and old. </p>

    <p class="hed">WHAT WILL ESWAL HELP YOU TO ACHIEVE?</p>
    <p class="para">Can you imagine your annual income becoming your monthly earnings? Your monthly earnings become your weekly earnings, which then become your daily earnings?
